In Java, a functional interface is an interface that has a single abstract method (SAM). There are several types of functional interfaces in Java, including:

1. _Predicate_: Represents a boolean-valued function of one argument.
2. _Function_: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
3. _Consumer_: Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
4. _Supplier_: Represents a supplier of results, with no input arguments.
5. _UnaryOperator_: Represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type.
6. _BinaryOperator_: Represents an operation on two operands that produces a result of the same type.
7. _BiPredicate_: Represents a boolean-valued function of two arguments.
8. _BiFunction_: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
9. _BiConsumer_: Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.

These functional interfaces are used extensively in Java 8's Stream API, lambda expressions, and method references. They provide a concise way to represent small, single-method functions that can be composed together to create more complex operations.

Here are some examples of using these functional interfaces:

- Predicate: `Predicate<String> isEmpty = String::isEmpty;`
- Function: `Function<String, Integer> length = String::length;`
- Consumer: `Consumer<String> print = System.out::println;`
- Supplier: `Supplier<String> hello = () -> "Hello";`
- UnaryOperator: `UnaryOperator<String> toUpperCase = String::toUpperCase;`
- BinaryOperator: `BinaryOperator<Integer> sum = (a, b) -> a + b;`
- BiPredicate: `BiPredicate<String, String> equals = String::equals;`
- BiFunction: `BiFunction<String, String, String> concat = (a, b) -> a + b;`
- BiConsumer: `BiConsumer<String, String> printPair = (a, b) -> System.out.println(a + " " + b);`

These are just a few examples of the many functional interfaces available in Java. By using these interfaces, you can write more concise and expressive code that is easier to read and maintain.
