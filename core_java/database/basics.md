- JDBC: is the raw, low-level API.
- JPA: is a specification for ORM, providing an abstraction over JDBC.
- Hibernate: is a concrete implementation of the JPA specification.
- Spring Data JPA: builds on top of JPA (and thus Hibernate) to further simplify data access in Spring applications by automating repository implementations.
